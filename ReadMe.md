NAME FOR THE WEBSITE:

Bass: The Music Store

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

“Bass: The Music Store” is an online music store which provides a music purchasing service to users. This model of an online music store contains the latest albums, the greatest hits of all time and billboard chartbusters.

Here are the key features of our website:

a.	Users can create an account for free and sign into the website to access all the music content available.

b.	Every album has its details shown in a small pop-up box. Users can click on the ADD button to purchase the song. This song then gets added to their Shopping Cart.

c.	Users can search for music content in two ways – Using the genre checkboxes or by using the search bar.

ASSUMPTION: We have restricted the search results to only pertain to ‘genre’ when a user searches for content using the search bar.

d.	At any point in time, the user can go to his/her cart to delete any song that he/she does not want to purchase.

e.	Once the user selects all the desired songs, he/she can click on the Cart to view all the items to be purchased. 

f.	The user can then place his/her order by clicking the PLACE ORDER button and view his/her ORDER HISTORY by accessing the ‘Order History’ option in the top menu.

ASSUMPTION: Since we have been instructed to not include payment functionality, our assumption for payment is based on the iTunes store model – every payment is linked to a primary account, much like the Apple account, which has all the user details and card payment details linked to it.
